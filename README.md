What is HttpURLConnection ? 
---
HttpURLConnection is a Java class that allows your program to communicate with web servers over the HTTP protocol. It helps you make requests to web servers to retrieve information (like a webpage or data from an API) and also to send information (like form data or JSON payloads). It's like a messenger between your program and the web server, enabling them to exchange data.
